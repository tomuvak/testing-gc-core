 * actually been collected â€“ it only signals that the functionality is supposed to be supported on the platform).
 *
 * On unsupported platforms (currently, and perhaps indefinitely, JS), does nothing and returns `false`.
 *
 * [tryToAchieveByForcingGc] should be considered as an alternative if a solution which covers JS as well is desired.

/**
 * Evaluates the given [condition] at least once and potentially multiple times (the exact number of times is
 * indeterminate and implementation/platform-specific, but bound) and returns `true` as soon as the [condition]
 * evaluates to `true`, or `false` if all evaluations resulted in `false`. Might try to trigger garbage collection along
 * the process, either directly (e.g. by invoking [whenCollectingGarbage] on platforms where it's supported) or
 * indirectly (e.g. by performing a memory-intensive task in the hope that garbage collection will be triggered).
 *
 * Can only be called from a coroutine.
 *
 * This function is more cumbersome than [whenCollectingGarbage], both in usage and in internal operation (which,
 * depending on platform and circumstances, may be memory- and computation-intensive), and is recommended to only be
 * used when targeting (also) a platform where [whenCollectingGarbage] isn't an option (= JS).
